# Examples

This repository contains small examples and files with sample data from the adecc Scholar channel. There is no real order, this repository is primarily for the exchange during the courses.

Examples are often dependent on an IDE, this can be Embarcadero C++Builder or Microsoft Visual Studio. Of course, many of the examples are also pure C++ and can be quickly adapted to other environments.
